=head1 NAME

Compress::LZ4Frame - Compression package using the lz4frame library

=head1 VERSION

version 0.008

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Compress::LZ4Frame qw(:all);

    my @data = map { rand } (1..50000);
    my $packed = pack('d*', @data);
    
    # compress
    my $compressed = compress($packed);
    # or with checksum
    my $compressed = compress_checksum($packed);

    # check data
    looks_like_lz4frame($compressed);   # some true value
    looks_like_lz4frame($packed);       # some false value

    # decompress
    my $decompressed = decompress($compressed);

    my @result = unpack('d*', $decompressed);
    # @result now contains the same values as @data did

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 compress

    $compressed = compress($data [, $level])

Uses the lz4frame library to compress the given data. The optional compression level is passed through to lz4frame.

=head2 compress_checksum

Usage is the same as compress. The only difference is, that a checksum is included into the resulting data,
which will be checked by decompress.

=head2 decompress

    $data = decompress($compressed)

Decompresses the given data.

=head2 looks_like_lz4frame

    $okay = looks_like_lz4frame($data)

Checks the given data for a valid LZ4 frame.

=head1 COMPATIBILITY

The format of the compressed data is incompatible to that of L<Compress::LZ4>, thus they are not interoperable.
Other than that this package should be compatible to every program/library working with the official lz4frame format.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Many thanks goes to the following individuals who helped improve C<Compress-LZ4Frame>:

I<Yann Collet> for creating the LZ4 library and the lz4frame format.

I<A. Sinan Ünür> for nmake support.
